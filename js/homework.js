Try to do the same thing as in the previous task, but when creating player objects try to do it dinammicaly (using loop).
For that you'll need data in following format:

Create a construction function that should contain properties for first number, second number, and method.

third for adding and fourth for subtracting. */

/* TASK 5:

Test your understanding of closures and scope with following examples.

IMPORTANT! - First read the task and try to give an answer,
and then copy the code to your file and check what do you get in console.


    QUESTION 1:

  Whatâ€™s the result of executing this code and why?


    ANSWER 1:
  --- the result is: 

  undefined 
  2

  because var a is called in console.log before declaration, 
  and the number two will be visible in console.log because function foo() is defined as function declaration.
  All that happened because of creation faze of hoisting.


    QUESTION 2:

  What is result?

    ANSWER 2:
  --- the result is: 

  nothing, 
  if we console.log firstResult and result:

      function otherFunction(input) {
        return a;
      }
      5


    QUESTION 3:

  What is the result of the following code? Explain your answer.

    ANSWER 3:
  --- the result is: 

  Aurelio De Rosa       -  because Aurelio De Rosa is scope for fullname in obj.properties
  function() {
    return this.fullname;
  }
  John Doe              -  because John Doe is scope for fullname in test();


    QUESTION 4:

  What will you see in the console for the following example?

    ANSWER 4:
  --- the result is:
    
    1
